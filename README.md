## Embedded_C_CaseStudy

In this case study the temperature of a seat is determined using **Embedded C** language. We use **Arduino atmega 328** microcontroller board in this case study. The case study is divided into three different activities. Here we used different sensors for different activities. In the first activity the button sensor is used to sense whether a person is available on the seat, later after sensing the availability of a person the next step takes place which is temperature sensing. Depending upon the temperature the heater will be turned on with the help of an LED to show the status of the heater. Then the value of the temperature can be displayed on to the Display CDD-CRO using PWM.
