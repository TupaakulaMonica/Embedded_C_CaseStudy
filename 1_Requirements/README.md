# Requirements

## Introduction
The case study is about Embedded Systems, Arduino ATMega328 microcontroller is used. Here the case study is divided into three differnt activities, where the button sensor will sense the presence of the person and as soon as the person's presence is detected the temperature sensor senses the temperature and switches on or off the heater using LED as barrier. The temperature values can be displayed on the CDD-CRO in the form of PWM. The drivers in the controller helps out to get the work done. Hence it helps in maintaining the proper temperature in areas where the values goes under minus degree celcuis.

## Features
* The system is robust and consumes less power as it uses AVR programming with aurduino board.
* It can sense the temperature and can adjust the heater accordingly.
* This system can be implemented in any of the devices for example in cool places, cars, trains,...etc.
* Efficient and low cost effective.

## SWOT - Strengths, Weakness, Oppurtunities and Threats
### Strengths
- Efficiency
- Robust and low cost efficient
- Easyily accessible by the user
- Can change the adjust the heater according to the temperature

### Weakness
- The microcontroller is not widely used these days.
- And this system cannot be used at normal Indian conditions, at room temperatures.

### Oppurtunities
- Same project can be taken up with other microcontrollers and can increase the features.
- Additional features can be added to this system depending on the product requirement. 

### Threats
- The microcontroller is outdated in the electronic industry.

## 4W's and 1H
* **What** - Seat Heating System
* **Where** - In cool places, Cars, Trains, Aeroplanes
* **When** - Temperature goes under minus degree celcuis
* **Why** - To maintain normal body temperature
* **How** - By using different sensors
